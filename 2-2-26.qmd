## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
mtcars
data <- mtcars
dim(data)
```

Part One:

-   32 observations

-   11 variables

-   rows represent car models.

-   car model is a categorical value

-   mpg (miles/gallon) is a numeric value

-   the data in this set was extracted from the 11974 Motor Trend magazine

Part Two:

-   addition

-   subtraction

-   exponents

-   division

-   multiplication

```{r}
pi_rounded_two_decimal_places <- round(pi, digits = 2)
print(pi_rounded_two_decimal_places)
```

Part Three:

-   changed the variable name "a" to represent that the function rounds pi to 2 decimal places

-   you can find this function in the environment section
